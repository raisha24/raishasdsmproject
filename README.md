EXPLANATORY PIECE
CinemaBot was built to be an interactive online bot built to help a film festival’s employees discover various entertainments whilst doing their jobs. This bot is a Slack Bot made with Phyton. The tools that I’ve used throughout creating this project are Sublime Text 3.1.1 and Terminal. The ZIP that I have emailed, cinemabot, contains the source code, the navigating files with mvenv and stackclient installed, as well as process evidence in the form of text. 

As for the current state, this completed code work appears not to be working at the end. My final step was running my bot code, cinemabot.py, through Terminal. However, after numerous tries and fixes, it appears that my code failed to run.

There are various possible reasons for this, including installation failures and syntax errors, concerning I did experiments with adding different event variables outside the tutorial I am using. Accordingly, those are the issues that I keep encountering throughout making this project, along with misunderstandings of terms and acronyms.

The event variables included in cinemabot.py was meant to generate various reactions. to give some examples, handle_command was added to signal the users that the bot is able to receive commands. Additionally, message_actions, written in JSON message format, is a dialog meant to help the users select movie panels.

Primarily, my aim to develop my code literacy across creating this project has been achieved. There are numerous things that I have learned about coding, its tools, language, along with its culture and community. Furthermore, I have learned these past weeks that creating a piece of code takes time and patience. Additionally, I learned that code may even be beneficial for social situation like organising an event or in collaborations.
